<p>Jessica Gliozzo is a research fellow at the Department of Computer Science, Università degli Studi di
Milano. She received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees, respectively in Medical Biotechnology (year
2014, final grade: 104/110) and Molecular Biotechnology and Bioinformatics (year 2016, final grade:
110/110 cum laude), in the same university. During her master’s internship at the Department of Computer
Science (AnacletoLab, Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Lab), she was a visiting researcher at
Royal Holloway, University of London (PACCANAROLAB, CENTRE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY, Department of 
Computer Science) where she worked on her master’s thesis regarding the development of a semi-
supervised network-based method for the prediction of patient’s clinical outcomes from genomic data,
which was later published on Nature Scientific Reports.</p>

<p>She was a research fellow at the hospital “U.O.C. Dermatologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda – Ospedale
Maggiore Policlinico” working on the bioinformatic analysis of whole genome and RNA sequencing data
from blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm and primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic
cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma samples to detect diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic markers. Later, she
worked on the analysis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at the “Neuroradiology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale
San Raffaele”. In particular, she collaborated in the application of statistical methods to decompose the
multi-exponential T2 signal coming from brain MRI to obtain myelin water fraction maps and study the
development of white matter in normal paediatric subjects and children affected by metachromatic
leukodystrophy.</p>

<p>She recently earned a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Milan (year 2024, cum laude) which
results are presented in her PhD thesis [39] entitled “Patient similarity networks-based methods for
multimodal data integration and clinical outcome prediction”. The PhD was part of the Collaborative
Doctoral Partnership (CDP) programme between Università degli Studi di Milano and Joint Research Centre
of the European Commission.</p>

<p>During these years, she worked on various research lines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analysis of unimodal and integration of multi-modal data through patient similarity networks</li>
  <li>Effective dimensionality reduction guided by intrinsic dimensionality for multi-modal data
fusion</li>
  <li>Genome-wide prediction of tissue-specific regulatory regions using deep neural networks</li>
  <li>Prediction of pathogenic variants in non-coding regions of the human genome related to
Mendelian diseases</li>
  <li>Methods for the integration, classification and the visual analysis of biomolecular networks</li>
  <li>Methods to perform cells count in immunohistochemistry images</li>
  <li>Bioinformatics analysis of Next Generation Sequencing data</li>
  <li>Human Digital Twin to track and prompt suggestions to improve the fitness status of athletes</li>
  
</ul>
